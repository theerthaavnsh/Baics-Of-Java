Here are step-by-step algorithms for each of these Java programming tasks:

### 30. Hierarchical Inheritance - Employee, Officer, and Manager

**Algorithm:**
1. **Create Class 'Employee':**
   - Define members: Name, Age, Phone number, Address, Salary.
   - Create a method `printSalary()` to print the Employee's salary.

2. **Create Class 'Officer' (Inherits 'Employee'):**
   - Add a member `specialization`.
   - Use super constructor to initialize inherited members.

3. **Create Class 'Manager' (Inherits 'Employee'):**
   - Add a member `department`.
   - Use super constructor to initialize inherited members.

4. **Create Objects and Assign Values:**
   - Create an object of 'Officer', set values, and call `printSalary()`.
   - Create an object of 'Manager', set values, and call `printSalary()`.

5. **Display Information:**
   - Print the details of the Officer and Manager along with their salaries.

### 31. Single Inheritance & Super Keyword - Employee and Engineer

**Algorithm:**
1. **Create Class 'Employee':**
   - Define methods `display()` (prints class name) and `calcSalary()` (prints default salary).

2. **Create Class 'Engineer' (Inherits 'Employee'):**
   - Override `calcSalary()` to display a different salary amount.

3. **Instantiate and Use 'Engineer' Object:**
   - Create an Engineer object.
   - Call `display()` and `calcSalary()` using this object.

### 32. Abstract Class and Polymorphism - Shape, Rectangle, Triangle, Hexagon

**Algorithm:**
1. **Create Abstract Class 'Shape':**
   - Define an abstract method `numberOfSides()`.

2. **Create Classes 'Rectangle', 'Triangle', 'Hexagon' (Inherit 'Shape'):**
   - Implement `numberOfSides()` in each class to return the number of sides for each shape.

3. **Instantiate and Display Number of Sides:**
   - Create objects of Rectangle, Triangle, and Hexagon.
   - Call `numberOfSides()` for each object and display the results.

### 33. Multiple Inheritance Using Interface - Sports, Student, Test, Results

**Algorithm:**
1. **Create Interface 'Sports':**
   - Define a final variable `sportwt` and an abstract method `putwt()`.

2. **Create Class 'Student':**
   - Define member variable `rollnumber`.
   - Implement methods `getNumber()` and `putNumber()`.

3. **Create Class 'Test' (Inherits 'Student'):**
   - Add members `term1`, `term2`.
   - Implement methods `getMarks()` and `putMarks()`.

4. **Create Class 'Results' (Inherits 'Test' and Implements 'Sports'):**
   - Implement `putwt()` method.
   - Define a method to display total score: term marks + sports weightage.

5. **Instantiate and Display Results:**
   - Create a 'Results' object, set values.
   - Display roll number, term marks, sports weightage, and total score.

For implementation, remember to correctly handle inheritance and interface implementation in Java, ensuring that the data encapsulation and method overriding are done as per the requirements of the problems.
