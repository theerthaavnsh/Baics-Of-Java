Certainly, Lester. Let's break down each question into step-by-step algorithms:

### 1. Quick Sort Algorithm for Sorting Names

**Algorithm:**
1. **Define the Quick Sort Function:**
   - Inputs: Array of names `names[]`, start index `start`, end index `end`.
   - Base condition: If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, return.
   - Call a partition function and get the partition index `pIndex`.
   - Recursively call the quick sort function for the left partition (`names`, `start`, `pIndex - 1`).
   - Recursively call the quick sort function for the right partition (`names`, `pIndex + 1`, `end`).

2. **Partition Function:**
   - Choose the end element as the pivot.
   - Initialize a variable `pIndex` at the start index.
   - Loop through the array from `start` to `end - 1`.
     - If an element is less than the pivot, swap it with the element at `pIndex`, and increment `pIndex`.
   - Swap the pivot element with the element at `pIndex`.
   - Return `pIndex`.

3. **Main Function:**
   - Initialize an array of names.
   - Call the quick sort function with the array, 0 as start index, and the length of the array minus 1 as the end index.

### 2. File Handling with Reader/Writer

**Algorithm:**
1. **Create a File Writer:**
   - Initialize a `FileWriter` object with the desired file path.
   - Write data to the file using the `write` method.
   - Close the `FileWriter`.

2. **Create a File Reader:**
   - Initialize a `FileReader` object with the same file path.
   - Read data from the file using a loop and the `read` method.
   - Display the read data.
   - Close the `FileReader`.

### 3. Read and Write Using `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`

**Algorithm:**
1. **Setup FileInputStream:**
   - Create a `FileInputStream` object for the source file.
   - Handle `FileNotFoundException`.

2. **Setup FileOutputStream:**
   - Create a `FileOutputStream` object for the destination file.
   - Handle `FileNotFoundException`.

3. **Read and Write:**
   - Use a loop to read data from the `FileInputStream`.
   - Write the read data to the `FileOutputStream`.
   - Handle `IOException`.

4. **Close Streams:**
   - Close both `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`.

### 4. Display File Content with Line Numbers

**Algorithm:**
1. **Open the File:**
   - Use `BufferedReader` with `FileReader` to open the file.

2. **Read and Display Lines:**
   - Initialize a line counter.
   - Read each line in a loop.
   - For each line, increment the counter and display the line number followed by the line content.

3. **Close the File:**
   - Close the `BufferedReader`.

### 5. Count Characters, Lines, and Words in a File

**Algorithm:**
1. **Open the File:**
   - Use `BufferedReader` with `FileReader`.

2. **Initialize Counters:**
   - Initialize counters for characters, lines, and words.

3. **Read and Count:**
   - Read the file line by line.
   - For each line, increment the line counter.
   - Split the line into words and increment the word counter.
   - Count the characters in each line and increment the character counter.

4. **Display Counts:**
   - Display the number of characters, words, and lines.

5. **Close the File:**
   - Close the `BufferedReader`.

These algorithms provide a high-level overview of the programs. When implementing in Java, you'll need to add the necessary imports and handle any exceptions appropriately.
